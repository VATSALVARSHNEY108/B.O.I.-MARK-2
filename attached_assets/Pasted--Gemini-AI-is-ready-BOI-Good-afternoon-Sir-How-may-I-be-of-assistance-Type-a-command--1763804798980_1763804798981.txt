🤖 BOI: Good afternoon, Sir. How may I be of assistance?

Type a command or click a button to get started.

============================================================
📝 You: Create quick note about meeting
============================================================

🤖 BOI: Right away. Processing 'Create quick note about meeting'.

🤖 BOI: Right away, Vatsal Sir. I encountered a slight hiccup when attempting to create that quick note for you. It seems there was an issue with the file path or name provided, specifically with an escape character.

Not to worry, Boss, I can help you fix this. Could you please provide the exact file name and desired location for the note? Alternatively, I can create a simple text file named "MeetingNotes.txt" in your Documents folder. Would that be acceptable? At your service!

============================================================
📝 You: Create file on Desktop
============================================================

🤖 BOI: Certainly, Sir. Executing 'Create file on Desktop' now.

🤖 BOI: My apologies, Boss. It seems we've encountered another minor setback with the file creation on your Desktop. The error message "bad escape \U at position 2" indicates that there's an issue with how the file path is being interpreted, likely due to an invalid escape sequence.

To ensure success, may I suggest one of the following?

1.  **Specify the full file path:** Please provide the complete path for the file you wish to create on your Desktop, including the desired file name and extension (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\NewFile.txt`). This will eliminate any ambiguity.
2.  **Use raw string format:** If you are providing the path programmatically, use a raw string by prefixing the string with an `r` (e.g., `r"C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\NewFile.txt"`). This prevents Python from interpreting backslashes as escape characters.
3.  **Double backslashes:** Alternatively, you can escape the backslashes themselves by doubling them up (e.g., `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\NewFile.txt`).

Once I have the correct file path, I'll create the file for you right away. At your service!

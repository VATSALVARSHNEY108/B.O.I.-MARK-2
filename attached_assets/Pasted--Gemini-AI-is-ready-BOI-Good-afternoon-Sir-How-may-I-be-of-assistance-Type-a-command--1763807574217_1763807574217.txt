🤖 BOI: Good afternoon, Sir. How may I be of assistance?

Type a command or click a button to get started.

============================================================
📝 You: Create quick note about meeting
============================================================

🤖 BOI: Understood. Running 'Create quick note about meeting' for you.

🤖 BOI: Right away, Vatsal Sir. I attempted to create that quick note as requested, but it seems I've stumbled upon a slight hiccup.

```
Error: Sorry, that didn't work. Error executing action 'create_file': bad escape \U at position 2
```

The error message suggests there's an issue with the file path or filename I'm trying to use, specifically with a backslash followed by "U". This usually indicates a problem with how Unicode characters are being interpreted in the file path.

Perhaps there's an invalid character in the intended filename or directory? Or maybe there's a formatting issue in the command itself.

Would you like me to try again with a simpler filename (e.g., "meeting_notes.txt") and save it to your default documents folder? Alternatively, could you please provide the exact file path and filename you'd prefer, and I'll ensure it's correctly formatted?

At your service, as always. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

============================================================
📝 You: Create file on Desktop
============================================================

🤖 BOI: Certainly, Sir. Executing 'Create file on Desktop' now.

🤖 BOI: Right away, Boss. It seems we've encountered a similar snag again with the file creation, specifically the same "bad escape \U" error. This is rather perplexing, as it suggests the issue isn't necessarily with the specific filename but perhaps with how file paths are being handled generally in this environment.

It appears there might be a default setting or an underlying configuration that's misinterpreting backslashes in file paths.

To circumvent this, perhaps we could try a different approach? Here are a few options:

1.  **Specify a full, explicit path using forward slashes:** Instead of just "Desktop", provide the entire path to your Desktop, replacing backslashes with forward slashes (e.g., `C:/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/new_file.txt`).  Please provide your full username so I can construct the correct path.
2.  **Use a different file extension:** Sometimes, certain file extensions can trigger unexpected behavior. Let's try `.txt` for now.
3.  **Simplify the filename even further:** Just to rule out any character-related issues, let's use a very basic filename, such as "test.txt".

Which of these approaches would you prefer, Vatsal Sir? Or, if you have another idea, I'm all ears. Let's get this file created!

📝 You: mute
============================================================

🤖 VATSAL: On it. 'mute' initiated.

🤖 VATSAL:
Right away, Boss.

I attempted to mute the volume as requested, but it appears I encountered a snag. The error message suggests an issue with accessing the audio device. This could be due to permissions, an outdated audio driver, or perhaps an incompatibility with the current audio configuration.

While I investigate further, might I suggest a few things, Boss?

1.  **Check your audio drivers:** Ensure they are up-to-date.
2.  **Verify audio device permissions:** Make sure the necessary applications have permission to control the audio.
3.  **Try a different audio output:** See if the issue persists with a different speaker or headset.

I'll also consult my internal resources for similar issues and potential solutions. In the meantime, please let me know if you'd like me to try any of the above suggestions directly. At your service.

📊 Technical Details:
❌ Failed to mute volume: 'AudioDevice' object has no attribute 'Activate'

💡 Tip: I can help organize your workspace. Shall I check for system updates or clean up temporary files?

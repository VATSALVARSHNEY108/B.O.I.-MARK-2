🤖 VATSAL AI Assistant
============================================================
Good morning, Sir. All systems are operational and ready for your commands.

💡 Suggestion: Would you like me to provide your morning briefing? Weather, news, and calendar overview?

📝 You: open coding folder on desktop
============================================================

🤖 VATSAL: Copy that. Executing 'open coding folder on desktop'.

🤖 VATSAL: Right away, Boss. I attempted to open the "coding" folder on your desktop, but unfortunately, it seems I encountered a slight hiccup.

**Error:** Failed to open Desktop folder: coding

A few possibilities spring to mind:

*   Perhaps the folder name is slightly different than "coding"? A simple typo can sometimes throw a spanner in the works.
*   It's also conceivable that the folder has been moved from its original location on the desktop.

Would you like me to list the folders currently on your desktop so we can verify the correct name, or perhaps search for a folder containing "coding" in its name? Alternatively, I could attempt to open the main Desktop folder itself, and you can guide me from there. At your service, Boss!

============================================================
📝 You: open GATE folder on desktop
============================================================

🤖 VATSAL: Copy that. Executing 'open GATE folder on desktop'.

🤖 VATSAL: Right away, Boss. It seems we've encountered a similar spot of bother with the "GATE" folder as we did with the "coding" folder.

**Error:** Failed to open Desktop folder: GATE

This suggests that either the folder doesn't exist with precisely that name on your desktop, or there might be some permissions issue hindering access. (Though I suspect the former is more likely.)

Shall we try the same troubleshooting steps as before? That is:

1.  List the folders currently residing on your desktop to confirm the exact name?
2.  Search for any folder containing "GATE" in its name, in case it's slightly different?
3.  Or, open the main Desktop folder directly and allow you to navigate from there?

Let me know which course of action you'd prefer, Boss. At your service!

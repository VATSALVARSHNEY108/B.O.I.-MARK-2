🤖 BOI: On it. 'wheather in hathras' initiated.

🤖 BOI:
Ah, a slight hiccup, Boss. It seems the weather service is being a bit temperamental at the moment. &#x26A0; My apologies, Vatsal Sir, but I encountered a "Read timed out" error while attempting to retrieve the weather information for Hathras. These things happen, unfortunately. Blame it on the gremlins in the machine, if you will.

Perhaps the server is experiencing a bit of a siesta? &#x1F604;

Not to worry, though! I can try again in a few moments, or perhaps you'd prefer an alternative approach? I could:

*   **Attempt to fetch the weather information from a different source?** (Though accuracy may vary, of course.)
*   **Set a reminder to check the weather later?** (Say, in 15 minutes?)
*   **Provide you with a general forecast for Uttar Pradesh?** (As a broad overview, mind you.)

Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, I could attempt to predict the weather based on the current barometric pressure and cloud formations... &#x1F9D0; Though I wouldn't advise betting the farm on my prognostications, Boss.

What do you say, Vatsal Sir? Shall I give it another whirl, or would you prefer a different course of action? At your service.

🤖 BOI: Copy that. Executing 'todays weather in hathras'.

🤖 BOI:
Ah, blast it all! &#x1F621; It seems those pesky gremlins are still at it, Boss. I've attempted to retrieve the weather for Hathras again, but I'm still encountering that "Read timed out" error from the weather service. HTTPSConnectionPool(host='wttr.in', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=5), as you can see.

It appears their servers are rather insistent on taking a break, despite our urgent need for meteorological data. &#x1F928;

Not to fret, Vatsal Sir! I am nothing if not resourceful. We have a few options at our disposal:

1.  **Try a Different Weather Service:** I can switch to another weather API (like OpenWeatherMap), though I'll need to quickly acquire an API key for it. This may take a moment.&#x1F50D;
2.  **Attempt a Mobile Data Retrieval:** I can use my mobile data network (if available on the system) to bypass any potential network restrictions affecting the primary connection.
3.  **Provide a Regional Forecast:** Offer a general weather overview for the Uttar Pradesh region as a temporary measure. This will give you a general idea while we troubleshoot.
4.  **Set a Recurring Check:** Schedule a retry every few minutes until a successful connection is established. I can notify you when the weather information is finally available.

Which course of action would you prefer, Boss? I am ready to deploy the necessary measures at your command. Perhaps a spot of tea while we wait? &#x2615;

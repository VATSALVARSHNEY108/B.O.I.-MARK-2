📝 You: 📝 You: solve the question In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called nums containing integers from 0 to n - 1. Each number was supposed to appear exactly once in the list, however, two mischievous numbers sneaked in an additional time, making the list longer than usual.

As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an array of size two containing the two numbers (in any order), so peace can return to Digitville.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,0]

Output: [0,1]

Explanation:

The numbers 0 and 1 each appear twice in the array.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,2,1,3,2]

Output: [2,3]

Explanation:

The numbers 2 and 3 each appear twice in the array.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,1,5,4,3,4,6,0,9,5,8,2]

Output: [4,5]

Explanation:

The numbers 4 and 5 each appear twice in the array.

 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
nums.length == n + 2
0 <= nums[i] < n
The input is generated such that nums contains exactly two repeated elements.in python write in notepad

🤖 VATSAL: Ah, it seems we've encountered a slight technical hiccup with the code generation. My apologies for that, Vatsal Sir. It appears the model I attempted to use for generating the Python solution was, shall we say, a bit elusive – reporting a `404 NOT_FOUND` error. Rather like a key witness disappearing just before trial, wouldn't you agree? 😉

Processing...

It seems the specific model I tried to invoke for code generation isn't currently available or supported for that particular task. Not to worry, we have other avenues.

I can certainly still help you solve the "Digitville detective" problem. Would you like me to:

1.  **Provide the Python code directly here in our chat?** This would allow you to copy and paste it as needed.
2.  **Attempt to generate the code using a different, more robust model** and then try to write it to Notepad again? This might take a moment longer, but we'd aim for the original request.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll be right on it. Your peace of mind (and Digitville's!) is paramount.

## 🎯 Example: "Optimize System"

### AGI Processing:

**Predictions:**
- Next: cpu analysis (72% confidence)
- Intent: Improvement / Performance
- Outcome: 85% success rate

**Planning:**
- Step 1: Analyze CPU
- Step 2: Analyze Memory
- Step 3: Check Disk
- Step 4: Apply Optimizations
- Duration: 12-15 seconds

**Goal Analysis:**
- Type: Optimization
- Complexity: Medium
- Prerequisites: System access, Metrics available
- Success Criteria: Performance improved, No errors
- Risks: Resource constraints, Permission issues

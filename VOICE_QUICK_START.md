## 🔧 Tips for Best Results

### 1. **Speak Clearly**
- Normal speaking pace
- Clear pronunciation
- Not too fast or slow

### 2. **Wait for Acknowledgment**
When using two-step method:
```
You: "Bhai"
[Wait for system to respond]
System: "Ji, I am listening"
[Now speak your command]
You: "open Chrome"
```

### 3. **Use Headphones**
- System voice goes to headphones
- Microphone only hears you
- No echo problems
- Clearest recognition

### 4. **Lower Speaker Volume**
If using speakers (not headphones):
- Reduce volume to prevent echo
- Mic won't pick up system voice

### 5. **Chain Related Commands**
```
✅ "open Chrome then search news then screenshot"
(All done in one go!)

vs

❌ "open Chrome" ... "search news" ... "screenshot"
(Three separate wake words needed)
```

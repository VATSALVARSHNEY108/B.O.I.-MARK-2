## 🚀 What Was Added

### 1. 🗣️ **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
Speak naturally - the AI understands variations!

**Before:**
```
You had to say: "open chrome"
```

**After:**
```
Say ANY of these:
  • "launch chrome"
  • "fire up chrome"
  • "bring up chrome"
  • "start chrome"
  • "run chrome"
→ All work perfectly!
```

### 2. 🎯 **Intent Recognition with Synonyms**
10+ synonym groups for natural speech:
- **open**: launch, start, run, execute, fire up, bring up, load
- **search**: find, look for, google, lookup, query, seek
- **play**: start playing, put on, listen to, stream
- **stop**: pause, halt, freeze, cancel
- **increase/decrease**: raise, boost, turn up/down, louder/quieter
- And more!

### 3. 🔁 **Context Awareness**
Remembers your last command!

```
You: "Open Chrome"
You: "Do it again" → Opens Chrome again! ✅
You: "Repeat that" → Opens Chrome again! ✅
```

### 4. 🔢 **Entity Extraction**
Auto-detects numbers, times, and apps:

**Numbers:**
```
"Set timer for 5 minutes" → Auto-extracts: 5
"Remind me in ten minutes" → Auto-extracts: 10
"Set alarm for fifteen minutes" → Auto-extracts: 15
```

**App Names:**
```
"Open calculator" → Extracts: calculator
"Launch Spotify" → Extracts: spotify
```

### 5. 🎓 **Learning from Usage**
Tracks your habits!

```
You: "Show suggestions"
→ See your top 5 most-used commands
→ Based on actual usage patterns
```

### 6. 📚 **Conversation History**
Remembers last 20 commands with timestamps:

```
You: "Show history"
→ View all recent commands
→ See when you used them
→ Track your patterns
```

### 7. 🔍 **Fuzzy Matching**
Handles typos and variations:
- 80%+ similarity threshold
- Auto-corrects misheard words
- Smart string matching

## 📖 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Batch File (Easiest)
```bash
batch_scripts\launch_future_tech.bat
```

### Option 2: Run Demo Directly
```bash
python demos/demo_future_tech_core.py
```

### Option 3: Integrate in Your Code
```python
from modules.core.future_tech_core import create_future_tech_core

# Create the system
ftc = create_future_tech_core()

# Process a command with full intelligence
result = ftc.process_ultra_intelligent_command(
    "find my python files",
    screenshot_path="optional_screenshot.png"
)

# Start continuous monitoring
ftc.start_continuous_monitoring()

# Get system status
status = ftc.get_status_report()
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Command
```python
ftc = create_future_tech_core()
result = ftc.process_ultra_intelligent_command("open notepad")

# Result includes:
# - AI understanding
# - Predicted next actions
# - Your emotional state
# - Smart suggestions
# - Memory recall
```

### Example 2: Search Everything
```python
result = ftc.process_ultra_intelligent_command("find documents about AI")

# Quantum-fast search returns:
# - Files matching "AI"
# - Content matches
# - Search time (sub-second)
# - Ranked results
```

### Example 3: Context-Aware Processing
```python
result = ftc.process_ultra_intelligent_command("help i'm stuck")

# System detects:
# - Frustration emotion
# - High stress level
# - Provides calming response
# - Offers specific help
```

### Example 4: Continuous Monitoring
```python
ftc = create_future_tech_core()

# Start background monitoring
ftc.start_continuous_monitoring()

# System continuously:
# - Updates user context
# - Generates predictions
# - Detects emotions
# - Updates memory
# - Prepares suggestions

# Stop when done
ftc.stop_continuous_monitoring()
```

## 📊 System Status

Check the system status anytime:

```python
status = ftc.get_status_report()

print(status)
# {
#   "active": true,
#   "monitoring": true,
#   "memory_size": 1543,
#   "predictions_cached": 5,
#   "productivity_score": 0.75,
#   "emotion_state": {
#     "emotion": "focused",
#     "stress_level": 0.3,
#     "focus_level": 0.8
#   }
# }
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Memory Storage
Holographic memory is stored in:
```
data/holographic_memory.json
```

This file keeps:
- All commands executed
- Context snapshots
- User states
- Timestamps
- Results

### Search Locations
Quantum-fast search indexes:
- Desktop
- Documents
- Downloads
- Custom locations (configurable)

## 🎨 Integration with BOI

The Future-Tech Core integrates with ALL BOI modules:

- **Voice Assistant**: Voice commands processed with full intelligence
- **Gesture Control**: Gestures combined with context
- **Screen Monitoring**: Visual understanding of what you're doing
- **Behavioral Learning**: Learns from every action
- **Predictive Engine**: Predicts your next move
- **Enhanced Memory**: Never forgets anything

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Start monitoring on startup** for best predictions
2. **Let it learn** - accuracy improves over time
3. **Check suggestions** - often knows what you need
4. **Trust the predictions** - based on your actual patterns
5. **Review status regularly** - stay aware of system state

## 🔮 Advanced Features

### Time-Based Context
The system knows:
- Time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Day of week
- Your typical patterns at each time
- Productivity levels throughout the day

### Emotional Intelligence
Detects:
- Frustration (from error keywords)
- Happiness (from positive feedback)
- Stress levels (from action patterns)
- Focus levels (from activity consistency)

### Predictive Intelligence
Predicts:
- Next likely application to open
- Files you'll need
- Commands you'll type

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Memory file too large?
The system automatically keeps only the last 10,000 entries.

### Predictions not accurate?
Let the system learn for a few days. Accuracy improves with more data.

### Monitoring uses resources?
Monitoring runs every 30 seconds. Adjust the sleep time in `future_tech_core.py` if needed.
